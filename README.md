# ETF Portfolio Simulator

A simple interactive ETF portfolio simulator for learning long-term investing and seeing how different asset allocations would have performed historically.

## MVP

- Inputs: initial investment, weights for 13 ETFs (VOO, QQQM, VTI, VXUS, VT, SCHD, IWM, XLV, XLF, XLE, BND, SGOV, BIL), time range (1 year / 3 years / 5 years / all)
- Outputs:
  1. Portfolio value chart, historical cumulative return, annualized return
  2. Drawdown chart: how far the portfolio fell below its previous peak, with the worst episode's peak, trough, and recovery dates and durations
  3. Risk–return scatter plot: annualized volatility (horizontal) vs annualized return (vertical) for your portfolio, preset portfolios, and single ETFs, plus annualized volatility and volatility reduction vs 100% VOO
- Method: monthly rebalancing; each month's portfolio return is the weighted average of the ETFs' monthly returns. Annualized volatility is the sample standard deviation of monthly returns multiplied by √12. Volatility reduction = (σ_VOO − σ_portfolio) / σ_VOO × 100%.

## Design

Black background, white text, left-aligned, following the habit of past pages (Vibe & Verify): simple and light, no colorful decoration.

## Data note

The common starting point for all ETFs is October 2020 (QQQM launched in October 2020, SGOV in May 2020), so “All” covers about 6 years.
Data is in `data.js`: month-end adjusted closes. Past performance does not predict future results; taxes, trading costs, and inflation are not included.
